# ⚠️ This Directory is Deprecated

**This `/wiki/` directory is no longer maintained.**

## Canonical Source

The authoritative source for all RIPP Protocol wiki content is now:

**`/docs/wiki/`** in the main repository

## Why This Change?

To maintain a single source of truth and enable automated wiki publishing via GitHub Actions, all wiki content has been consolidated to `/docs/wiki/`.

## What You Should Do

- **For reading**: Visit the [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/Dylan-Natter/ripp-protocol/wiki) or browse `/docs/wiki/` directly
- **For editing**: Submit PRs to `/docs/wiki/` - changes are automatically published to the GitHub Wiki on merge to `main`
- **For development**: See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full documentation governance model

## Migration

This directory (`/wiki/`) will be removed in a future release. All content has been migrated to `/docs/wiki/` with the following improvements:

- Automated sync to GitHub Wiki via CI/CD
- Single source of truth for all documentation
- Proper version control and PR review process
- Additional content (Auto-Versioning-Setup.md, Copilot-Mode.md, VS-Code-Extension-vNext.md)
