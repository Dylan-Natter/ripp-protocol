## Press Kit

Brand guidelines, boilerplate text, and messaging for RIPP.

---

## Official Name

**Regenerative Intent Prompting Protocol (RIPP)**

### Naming Rules

✅ **Correct:**

- Regenerative Intent Prompting Protocol (RIPP)
- RIPP Protocol
- RIPP v1.0
- RIPP

❌ **Incorrect:**

- Ripp
- ripp
- R.I.P.P.
- Regenerative Prompting Protocol

**First mention**: Use full name "Regenerative Intent Prompting Protocol (RIPP)"  
**Subsequent mentions**: Use "RIPP"

---

## Tagline

**Build fast. Ship safely. Regenerate always.**

---

## Short Descriptors

Use these for headlines, social media, or summaries:

1. **"An open standard for structured feature specifications"**
2. **"Turn ideas into production features without losing intent"**
3. **"Machine-readable, human-reviewable specs for modern development"**

---

## One-Paragraph Boilerplate

> **Regenerative Intent Prompting Protocol (RIPP)** is an open standard for capturing feature requirements as structured, machine-readable, human-reviewable specifications. RIPP packets are single YAML or JSON files that describe purpose, user flows, data contracts, API contracts, permissions, failure modes, and acceptance criteria. By making the specification the primary artifact, RIPP enables teams to review features before writing code, preserve original intent throughout development, and ship production systems with clarity and confidence. RIPP is open source, MIT licensed, and designed for AI-augmented workflows where ideas move fast but quality cannot degrade.

## Two-Paragraph Version

> **Regenerative Intent Prompting Protocol (RIPP)** is an open standard for capturing feature requirements as structured, machine-readable, human-reviewable specifications. RIPP packets are single YAML or JSON files that describe purpose, user flows, data contracts, API contracts, permissions, failure modes, and acceptance criteria. By making the specification the primary artifact, RIPP enables teams to review features before writing code, preserve original intent throughout development, and ship production systems with clarity and confidence.

> RIPP addresses a critical problem in modern software development: **intent erosion**. Ideas conceived with clear purpose often degrade during implementation as requirements scatter across tickets, docs, and conversations. RIPP solves this by providing a structured, versioned, and validated format for specifications. With three conformance levels (1, 2, and 3), teams choose the rigor appropriate for each feature's risk and complexity. RIPP is open source, MIT licensed, and designed for AI-augmented workflows where ideas move fast but quality cannot degrade.

---

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> "RIPP is like a structured contract for software features. Instead of scattering requirements across Jira, docs, and Slack, you write one YAML file that describes what the feature does, how it works, what can go wrong, and how to test it. Teams review the spec before writing code, catch issues early, and ship with confidence. It's open source and takes 30 minutes to get started."

## Key Messages

Use these messages in talks, articles, and presentations:

### 1. RIPP Preserves Intent

"RIPP is called 'regenerative' because it preserves and regenerates the original intent of a feature throughout development. The 'why' survives the 'how.'"

### 2. RIPP Enables Spec-First Development

"RIPP shifts specification from after coding to before coding. Write the spec, review it, approve it, then build it. Catch issues before they become code."

### 3. RIPP Is Progressive

"RIPP has three levels. Level 1 is simple—just purpose, UX, and data. Level 3 is comprehensive—audit events, NFRs, and acceptance tests. Choose based on risk."

### 4. RIPP Is Machine-Validated

"RIPP packets are validated against a JSON Schema. CI checks ensure specs are complete and conformant. No manual checklists."

### 5. RIPP Is Language Agnostic

"RIPP describes behavior, not implementation. Use any programming language, any framework. RIPP is the contract, not the code."

### 6. RIPP Is Designed for AI Workflows

"AI generates ideas in seconds and prototypes in minutes. RIPP ensures those ideas make it to production without degrading into chaos."

### 7. RIPP Is Open and Free

"RIPP is MIT licensed. No vendor lock-in, no external dependencies. GitHub is the source of truth. All decisions are public."

## Logo and Visual Identity

### Icon

RIPP has an official icon used in tooling and GitHub Pages:

<img src="{{ '/assets/icon.png' | relative_url }}" alt="RIPP Icon" style="width: 96px; height: 96px; border-radius: 12px;">

**Usage:**

- The icon is available at `/docs/assets/icon.png` in the repository
- Used in the VS Code extension, GitHub Pages, and other RIPP tooling
- The icon features a green background with a white circular profile symbol and "RIPP" text

### Text Logo Usage

When representing RIPP in text-only contexts, use:

```
RIPP
```

**Font**: Use a clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Roboto, Helvetica)  
**Color**: Dark text on light background, or light text on dark background  
**Styling**: Avoid gradients, shadows, or decorative elements

### Example Text Logo (ASCII)

## Sample Use Cases for Marketing

### For Engineering Teams

"Reduce code review time by catching issues in spec review. Write RIPP packets before coding, approve them, then build confidently."

### For Product Managers

"Ensure features are built as intended. RIPP packets are the contract between product and engineering."

### For Platform Teams

"Enforce standards across features with automated validation. Require Level 2 for APIs, Level 3 for auth and payments."

### For Executives

"Ship faster with fewer production surprises. RIPP documents what can go wrong before it does."

### For Compliance Teams

"RIPP Level 3 packets document audit events, data handling, and compliance requirements. Audits become easier."

### For Open Source Projects

"Make it easy for contributors to understand features. RIPP packets serve as living documentation."
